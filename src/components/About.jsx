                    <p className="text-justify nunito-exlight">I am a passionate Front-End developer who transitioned from a background in Zoology (Hons) to the exciting world of technology. A deep curiosity drove my journey into tech to understand systems and problem-solving. I discovered my love for coding and the endless possibilities it offers, which led me to explore web development.

With hands-on experience in CodeIgniter for Back-End development and React for Front-End integration, I specialize in building dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications with the latest and most in-demand technologies. My learning phase has instilled a keen attention to detail, analytical thinking, and a systematic approach to development, all of which play a significant role in how I approach coding and problem-solving.

During my time at Krold IT Solutions and my internship at Technosoft Academy, I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with diverse teams, working on exciting projects for domestic as well as international clients. I take pride in delivering high-quality web and app solutions, optimizing user experiences, and creating seamless interactions that make websites both functional and beautiful.

I’m always excited to learn new technologies, improve my skills, and contribute to projects that solve real-world problems. As a developer, my goal is to continue growing and evolving in this ever-changing tech landscape, while always keeping the user at the heart of my work.
